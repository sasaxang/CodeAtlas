Welcome to my Linux learning journey — a space where I document what I’ve learned, what I’ve tried, and what I’ve broken (on purpose). This is part of my broader effort to build modular, cross-platform workflows that are both functional and personal.

Goals
- Understand Linux fundamentals from the ground up
- Automate repetitive tasks with shell scripting
- Explore system tools, networking, and WSL quirks
- Build a library of reusable snippets and experiments
- Document mistakes, insights, and weird edge cases

Folder Structure
- ShellBasics.md – navigation, pipes, redirection, and command fluency
- Scripting/ – bash syntax, loops, flags, and annotated scripts
- System/ – permissions, processes, filesystems, and systemd
- Networking/ – curl, ping, SSH, firewall basics
- PackageManagement.md – apt, snap, flatpak, and update strategies
- WSL/ – setup, interop with Windows, and performance tweaks
- Experiments/ – awk, sed, grep/xargs pipelines and playful hacks

Learning Philosophy
I learn best by doing, breaking, and documenting. This folder reflects that:
- Every .md file is a mix of notes, examples, and reflections
- I include mistakes and misunderstandings — they’re part of the process
- Scripts are modular and annotated for reuse and clarity

Next Steps
- Add real-world use cases to Scripting/examples.sh
- Benchmark WSL performance tweaks
- Explore systemd timers and custom services
- Build a mini CLI tool using bash functions
